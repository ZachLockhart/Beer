## Ingredients

*  5 1/2 pounds dry light malt extract
*  1/2 pound Crystal 20L malt, crushed
*  1/2 pound American 6-row malt, crushed
*  1/2 ounce Centennial hops—60 minutes
*  1 ounce Cascade hops—15 minutes
*  1 ounce Centennial hops—15 minutes
*  1 ounce Cascade hops at flame out
*  1/2 ounce Centennial hops at flame out
*  6 gallons of tap water, split. If possible, place 3 gallons in the refrigerator to cool in a sanitized container.
*  11.5 gram package Safale US-05

## Directions

1.  Tie the American 6-row malt and Crystal 20L malt in a mesh hop-bag. Heat 1 gallon of water in a large pot to 160°F and remove from heat. Add malt and let steep for 20 minutes.

2.  Raise temperature slowly to 170°F. Make sure mesh bag isn’t sitting directly on the bottom of the pot. Remove the grain bag and add water to make 3 gallons total.

3.  Bring the wort to a vigorous boil. As water is heating, slowly add malt extract, stirring constantly until completely dissolved. When boil begins, add 1/2 ounce Centennial hops in mesh bag.
    
4.  After 45 minutes of boiling has passed, add 1 ounce Cascade and 1 ounce Centennial in mesh bag.
    
5.  After total of 60 minutes of boil remove from heat, add 1 ounce Cascade and 1/2 ounce Centennial in mesh bag and cover. Warning: After wort cools below 180°F everything that touches it should be sanitary, and exposure to open air should be limited as much as possible.
    
6.  Cool wort by placing pot in ice bath until it is below 85°F. Transfer to sanitized fermentor (either a carboy or a fermentation bucket). Top off to 5 gallons using refrigerated water.
    
7.  Sanitize outside of yeast package, fermentation stopper and airlock. Carefully pour yeast into cooled wort (it should be below 70°F), and agitate vigorously. Ferment in dark place, keeping ambient temperature consistent, preferably between 62-66°F.
    
8.  Bottle after two to three weeks
